# Phase 4: Configure and Run Evals

This phase covers two distinct eval types. Both apply to every tile (single-skill and multi-skill alike).

- **Activation eval** (`--solver=activation`): observes which skill self-activates per scenario. Does NOT force activation. Tests routing/description quality. Fast — completes in ~2–3 min.
- **Content eval** (default solver): forces activation, runs the agent twice (baseline + with-context), scores the rubric. Tests content quality. Slow — ~10–15 min per scenario per agent.

**Ordering:** for multi-skill tiles run activation first (catches routing problems before scored time is invested); for single-skill tiles either order is fine, parallel works too. Both are required — the variable is ordering, not whether to run them.

## Phase 4a: Activation eval

```bash
tessl eval run <tile-path> --solver=activation --label <run-label>
```

This completes in ~2–3 min (no agent execution needed). Note the eval run URL from the output and share it with the user.

Activation results are reviewed in Phase 5 — they do not produce a numeric score; they produce a per-scenario firing pattern (which skill, if any, fired on each scenario). Pair them with content-eval baseline scores to distinguish "no activation but agent handles it fine" from "no activation and agent needs help" (a real routing gap).

Poll for completion as described in §Polling below.

## Phase 4b: Content (task) eval

### Choose agents and models

For a first run, recommend keeping it simple:

> "For a first run, I recommend just using `claude:claude-sonnet-4-6` to keep eval time manageable (~10–15 minutes per scenario). Once you've validated the scenarios are good, you can add more agents to compare.
>
> Want to go with the default, or test multiple agents now?
>
> **Available agents:**
>
> | Agent | Models |
> |-------|--------|
> | `claude` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` (default), `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-opus-4-5`, `claude-haiku-4-5` |
> | `cursor` | `auto`, `composer-1.5` |
>
> Note: Each additional agent multiplies the eval run time and cost."

Build the `--agent` flags based on their choice. For multi-agent, each agent is a separate `--agent` flag:
```
--agent=claude:claude-sonnet-4-6 --agent=cursor:auto
```

### Run the eval

```bash
tessl eval run <tile-path> \
  --agent=<agent1:model1> \
  [--agent=<agent2:model2>] \
  --label <run-label>
```

Note the eval run URL from the output and share it with the user so they can optionally watch progress in the browser.

---

## Polling for completion (both eval types)

```bash
tessl eval list --mine --limit 1
```

For **content evals**, runs take ~10–15 minutes per scenario per agent. Each scenario runs twice (baseline without context + with-context). Update the user periodically:

> "Evals are running... Status: in_progress. With N scenarios and 1 agent, expect about X–Y minutes total. I'll check again shortly."

For **activation evals**, expect ~2–3 min total — much faster polling.

Wait until status shows `completed`. If status shows `failed`, run:
```bash
tessl eval retry <id>
```
